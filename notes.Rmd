```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

## Running Code

```{r}
1 + 1
x <- 6
y <- 8
z <- x+y
print (z)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
warning=FALSE
library(tidyverse)
d <- read_csv("/Users/madinaseidualy/Desktop/Data_Analyses/data-wrangling.csv",col_names = TRUE)

fbm<-d$Body_mass_female_mean
fbz<-d$Brain_Size_Species_Mean
mean(fbm, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(fbz, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(fbm,fbz)
plot(log(fbm),log(fbz))
plot(log(fbz),log(fbm))

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
